Write a function that takes a number of cents, and that returns a hash containing the least number of coins needed to generate the value of cents.

eg. If you have 31 cents you should return {:quarter => 1, :nickel => 1, :penny => 1};

eg. If you have 93 cents {:quarter => 3, :dime => 1, nickel => 1, :penny => 3}
